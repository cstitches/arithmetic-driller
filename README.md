# Arithmetic Driller v1

[LIVE PREVIEW](https://cstitches.github.io/arithmetic-driller/)

A random arithmetic problem generator for practicing mental math that generates problems based on user settings.

This is v1, basic core functionality in place, but lots of fine-tuning still to do.

## Features

- Able to select any combination of operators
- Able to set number value ranges between 0 - 1,000,000
- Keyboard controls for faster drilling

## Known Issues

- Not yet responsive (coming next!)
- Input controls needed for non-numeric input
- Input controls needed for handling max < min with number ranges
- Some issues with keyboard controls
- Not yet browser & OS compatibility tested

## Future Development

- Keyboard controls for operators
- Better optimization for drilling speed
- Support for negative numbers
- Support for decimals
- Scorekeeping and/or logging of correct and incorrect answers
- Timer option for timed challenges

## Credits

Credit to a seemingly unremarkable website I once stumbled across, which offered this same functionality, and with which I became really fast as mental math for a while. I've never been able to find it again, so I made my own.
